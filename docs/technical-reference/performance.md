# Performance Optimization

Package Fast is designed for exceptional performance, providing 5-10x faster installations compared to traditional package managers. This document explains the performance features and optimization techniques.

## Performance Targets

Package Fast aims to achieve these performance targets:

| Metric | Target | Compared to npm |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Clean Install | 3-6 seconds | 5-10x faster |
| Repeat Install | < 0.5 seconds | 2-3x faster |
| Developer First Install | < 1 second | 8-10x faster |
| Disk Usage | 50% reduction | Through deduplication |
| Memory Usage | Efficient GC | Reduced footprint |

## Core Performance Features

### 1. Parallel Processing

Package Fast utilizes parallel processing at multiple levels:

#### Dependency-level Parallelism
- Independent dependency subtrees are installed concurrently
- Worker pool dynamically adjusts based on system resources
- Default concurrency: CPU cores + 2

#### Package-level Parallelism
- Multiple packages are extracted simultaneously
- Separate I/O threads for file operations
- Optimized resource allocation

#### Script Execution Parallelism
- Lifecycle scripts run with controlled concurrency
- Isolated environments prevent interference
- Resource limits prevent system overload

### 2. Content-Addressed Storage

Package Fast uses content-addressed storage to optimize disk usage:

#### Hard Link Deduplication
- Identical packages are stored only once
- Hard links reference the single stored copy
- Reduces disk usage by up to 50%

#### Copy-on-Write Optimization
- Uses filesystem copy-on-write when available
- Further reduces disk usage and I/O operations
- Supported on modern filesystems (APFS, Btrfs, etc.)

### 3. Intelligent Caching

Multi-level caching strategy optimizes network usage:

#### Memory Cache
- LRU cache for frequently accessed metadata
- Configurable size (default 100MB)
- Per-process scope for optimal performance

#### Local Package Cache
- Content-addressable storage with tarball fingerprints
- Hard link deduplication for identical packages
- Optional compression for older packages

#### Registry Metadata Cache
- Time-based invalidation with configurable TTL
- Selective refresh for frequently updated packages
- Differential updates when supported by registry

### 4. Network Optimization

Efficient network utilization minimizes installation time:

#### Connection Management
- Persistent HTTP/HTTPS connections
- HTTP/2 support for compatible registries
- Adaptive connection pooling

#### Request Optimization
- Bulk metadata requests reduce round trips
- Delta updates when supported by registry
- Compression for all network traffic

#### CDN and Mirror Support
- Automatic mirror selection based on latency
- Fallback mechanisms for failed requests
- Custom registry endpoint configuration
