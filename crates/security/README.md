# Package Fast Security Module

The security module for Package Fast provides comprehensive security features to ensure the integrity, safety, and compliance of package installations and operations.

## Features

### 1. Package Integrity Verification
- Cryptographic verification of package contents using SHA-512 hashes
- Protection against tampering and corruption during transit
- Support for digital signatures (planned)

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning
- Integration with multiple vulnerability databases:
  - National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
  - Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV)
  - GitHub Advisory Database
- Real-time vulnerability detection during package installation
- Detailed vulnerability reports with severity ratings

### 3. Audit Trail Generation
- Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant operations
- Exportable audit trails in JSON and CSV formats
- Compliance-ready audit records

### 4. Runtime Protection
- Sandboxed execution of package lifecycle scripts
- File system access controls
- Network access restrictions
- Process execution limitations
- Resource usage limits

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- Detailed performance metrics for security operations
- Performance threshold alerts
- Timing and resource usage tracking

## Architecture

The security module is organized into several components:

```
security/
├── integrity/          # Package integrity verification
├── vulnerability/      # Vulnerability scanning
├── vuln_db/           # Vulnerability database clients
├── audit/             # Audit trail generation
├── runtime/           # Basic runtime protection
├── sandbox/           # Advanced sandboxing
├── service/           # Unified security service interface
└── performance/       # Performance monitoring
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```rust
use package_fast_security::{SecurityService, SecurityServiceConfig};

// Create a security service with default configuration
let mut security_service = SecurityService::new();

// Verify package integrity
security_service.verify_package_file_integrity(
    "package-name",
    "1.0.0",
    Path::new("/path/to/package.tgz"),
    "expected-sha512-hash"
).await?;

// Scan for vulnerabilities
let report = security_service.scan_package_for_vulnerabilities(
    "package-name",
    "1.0.0"
).await?;

// Execute a package script with runtime protection
security_service.execute_package_script(
    "package-name",
    "postinstall",
    Path::new("/path/to/script.sh"),
    Path::new("/working/directory")
).await?;
```

### Advanced Configuration

```rust
use package_fast_security::{SecurityService, SecurityServiceConfig};

let config = SecurityServiceConfig {
    verify_integrity: true,
    scan_vulnerabilities: true,
    generate_audit_trail: true,
    enable_runtime_protection: true,
    audit_trail_file: Some("security-audit.log".to_string()),
};

let mut security_service = SecurityService::with_config(config);
```

## Security Design Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for package operations
3. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure configuration out of the box
4. **Transparency**: Clear audit trails and security reporting
5. **Performance**: Security features that don't compromise performance

## Integration Points

The security module integrates with other Package Fast components:

- **Package Resolution Engine**: Provides integrity verification for resolved packages
- **Fetch and Cache Manager**: Scans packages for vulnerabilities during download
- **Installation Executor**: Enforces runtime protection during script execution
- **Plugin System**: Allows security extensions and custom security policies

## Performance Considerations

Security operations are designed to be lightweight:

- Asynchronous operations to avoid blocking
- Performance monitoring to detect bottlenecks
- Configurable security levels for different environments
- Caching of security data to reduce repeated operations

## Testing

The security module includes comprehensive tests:

- Unit tests for each security component
- Integration tests for end-to-end security workflows
- Performance tests for security operations
- Security tests for sandboxing mechanisms

Run tests with:
```bash
cd crates/security
cargo test
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned security features:

- Digital signature verification
- Supply chain security (provenance tracking)
- Advanced threat detection
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems
